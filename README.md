Steganography is the art and science of hiding information within other non-secret data, effectively concealing the existence of the hidden message. In the context of digital images, steganography allows for the secure embedding of confidential information within the pixel data of an image file.
Key Concepts:
Cover Image: The original image that will be used to hide the secret data. This image should be of sufficient size and quality to accommodate the hidden information without noticeable degradation.

Secret Data: The information that needs to be concealed, which can be text, another image, or any binary data.

Stego Image: The resulting image after the secret data has been embedded. Ideally, this image should appear visually indistinguishable from the cover image to prevent detection.

Techniques for Steganography:
Least Significant Bit (LSB) Insertion: This is one of the most common techniques where the least significant bits of the pixel values in the cover image are replaced with bits from the secret data. Since changes in the least significant bits have minimal impact on the overall appearance of the image, this method is effective for hiding data without detection.

Masking and Filtering: This technique involves manipulating the image in a way that the hidden data is embedded in the more significant bits of the image, often used in grayscale images. It can provide a higher capacity for data hiding but may also lead to more noticeable changes.

Transform Domain Techniques: These methods involve transforming the image into a different domain (like frequency domain using Discrete Cosine Transform or Discrete Wavelet Transform) and embedding the data in the transformed coefficients. This can provide better robustness against image processing attacks.

Security Measures:
Encryption: Before embedding the secret data, it can be encrypted using cryptographic algorithms. This adds an additional layer of security, ensuring that even if the stego image is detected, the hidden data remains secure.

Redundancy and Error Correction: Implementing redundancy and error correction codes can help recover the hidden data even if some parts of the stego image are altered or corrupted.

Watermarking: Combining steganography with watermarking techniques can enhance security by ensuring that the stego image can be traced back to its original owner, deterring unauthorized use.

Applications:
Secure Communication: Steganography can be used to send confidential messages over insecure channels without raising suspicion.
Digital Rights Management: Protecting intellectual property by embedding ownership information within digital media.
Data Integrity: Ensuring that the data has not been tampered with by embedding checksums or hashes within the image.
